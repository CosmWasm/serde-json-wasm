# Status

This crate is currently being passively maintained by [@japaric]. I (@japaric)
will be merging PRs (bug fixes and features) as they appear without any
long-term / design consideration. If you would like to take over the steering
wheel (i.e. take ownership of this crate) send me an e-mail (see my GitHub
profile).
